# CIFAR-10 Convolutional Neural Networks
Image classification and analysis using CNN on the benchmark dataset CIFAR-10. 
It features regularization technique to maximise the model performance on the test set. 
The analysis provide insight on the correlation between pixel and accuracy by applying patch over the image.
